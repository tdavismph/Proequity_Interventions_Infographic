        <h1>Pro-Equity Health Intervention Rankings by Country</h1>
        
        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>This tool is based on analysis of World Bank Country Equity Data for choosing Pro-equity interventions for immunization. Details of each recommended intervention, including a PDF with data sources, can be found here: <a href="https://zdlh.gavi.org/resources/evidence-map" target="_blank">https://zdlh.gavi.org/resources/evidence-map</a>.</p>
            
            <p>For each intervention chosen using the pull-down menu, it shows the countries where the particular intervention could be most helpful ("Highest Priority") and reasonably or possibly helpful (Priority 2, etc.). It also shows an average rank, and provides rationales for the ranking by country. At the bottom of the page, you will find the rankings of all countries (with many "ties") by intervention. Some of the pro-equity interventions that did not come up in the top five may be useful in some contexts and subregions of countries nonetheless.</p>

        "Avg. Rank": 3.2,
        "Rationale": "Pakistan: Severe financial hardship (30% of population) requires direct financial support. Malawi: High financial hardship and foregone care. Mali: Out-of-pocket costs are a major barrier. Bangladesh: Financial barriers are not the biggest issue, but small incentives help ultra-poor families. Cambodia: High OOP spending but not the primary barrier—targeted financial incentives can improve access for the poorest. Ethiopia: Financial barriers exist but are not the primary driver—targeted support for the poorest can help. Mozambique: OOP spending disproportionately affects the poor; targeted cash transfers can prevent foregone care. Niger: High financial hardship requires targeted subsidies to ensure immunization uptake. Sierra Leone: Nearly 40% of the population faces financial hardship due to health OOP—targeted cash transfers can help. Tajikistan: Financial hardship affects 7-10% of the population—subsidies can prevent poverty-driven care avoidance."

        "Rationale": "Bangladesh: Demand-side barriers and vaccine hesitancy require CHW engagement. Pakistan: Large crude-effective coverage gaps suggest poor service delivery—CHWs bridge the gap. Malawi: CHWs crucial for demand generation in remote areas. Mali: CHWs essential for conflict-affected, low-access regions. Cambodia: CHWs crucial for bridging service gaps, addressing maternal health disparities, and improving immunization uptake. Ethiopia: CHWs are essential for addressing maternal health disparities and vaccine demand generation. Mozambique: CHWs are critical for bridging service gaps in rural and conflict-affected regions. Niger: CHWs are crucial for improving access to maternal health and child vaccination in remote areas. Sierra Leone: CHWs are needed to enhance vaccine confidence and demand-side interventions. Tajikistan: CHWs can play a key role in improving maternal health service uptake."

Malawi: Ensures proper service delivery in low-readiness areas. Mali: Needed to track supply chain and absenteeism. Cambodia: Service quality issues remain, and CBM can ensure effective service delivery. Ethiopia: Service quality gaps and stockouts require CBM to ensure accountability. Mozambique: Ensures service continuity and stock monitoring, particularly in conflict zones. Niger: Needed to track and improve service quality and vaccine availability. Sierra Leone: Can strengthen immunization programs by reducing dropout rates. Tajikistan: Helps track service disparities and improve service responsiveness."

Mali: High geographic disparities—mobile outreach crucial. Pakistan: Data gaps limit GIS effectiveness, but microplanning is still useful. Cambodia: Within-region inequalities dominate; microplanning essential for targeting local socioeconomic disparities. Ethiopia: Geographic disparities in health services require localized microplanning. Mozambique: High geographic inequities mean targeted service planning is crucial. Niger: Vast disparities between and within regions require localized outreach strategies. Sierra Leone: Needed for rural and underserved regions where service gaps exist. Tajikistan: Within-region disparities in health services necessitate refined microplanning."

Malawi: Needed due to worsening child health indicators. Mali: Important in conflict zones to ensure multi-service access. Cambodia: Key child health services (PNC, child illness treatment) have declined—integrated health campaigns can reverse this trend. Ethiopia: Declining full immunization rates require bundled campaigns with maternal and child health services. Mozambique: Immunization rates dropped significantly—bundling with nutrition and maternal care can reverse this trend. Niger: Service delivery gaps necessitate multi-service outreach. Sierra Leone: Can be used to improve vaccine access in hard-to-reach communities. Tajikistan: Declining postnatal care services suggest an opportunity for integrated outreach."
